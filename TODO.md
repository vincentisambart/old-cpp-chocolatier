- add license
- be able to specify SDK name and machine architecture
- look if there isn't a way with clang to get the framework a class is in (as Swift might be doing it)
- remove old method that have been deprecated for a long time
- maybe also use the selectors in core from the other modules
- for structs add asserts to make sure layout and alignment are as in C like bindgen does
- make sure we handle a struct/union declared in an other struct/union
